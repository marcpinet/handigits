# Handigits

## 📝 Description

The goal of this project was to make a deep learning model that could recognize hand signs digits, no matter the environment.

Every information you need is in the source code, but here are some important points:

- The dataset used is: [Sign-Language-Digits-Dataset](https://github.com/ardamavi/Sign-Language-Digits-Dataset)
- The library I use to detect the hand is: [mediapipe](https://github.com/google-ai-edge/mediapipe)

I don't think this project deserves a bigger README, like my other projects.

It was primarily made for fun and to learn more about real-time processing and deep learning.
